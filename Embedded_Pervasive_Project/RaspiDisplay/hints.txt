General
    * Please write down all commands you needed to perform in order to get the thing running
    * Also provide all files for this
    * Receive data over MQTT
    * Store data in some form (maybe Database, maybe CSV, etc)
	* Light LED depending on water status
    * Display data on webinterface
    
Python
    * Read data over MQTT (see MQTT)
    * Store data to database
        * see https://pynative.com/python-mysql-database-connection/
        * see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/372885/how-do-i-connect-to-a-mysql-database-in-python

MQTT
    * see: https://tutorials-raspberrypi.de/datenaustausch-raspberry-pi-mqtt-broker-client/
    * Importance:
        * The DisplayRaspberry has the server running on it (so install mosquitto)
        * subscribe to service running on the raspberrypi
            * water for true/false if it is watered
            * temp for current temperature
        * sudo pip install paho-mqtt
            * Maybe look this part up for python integration

Webservice
    * Suggestion: Use Apache2 + PHP
    * Database: MariaDB / MySQL
    * PHP 7 (and newer subversions)

Datastora
    * Suggestion: Very simple MariaDB / MySQL database
    * 1 Table with 4 columns
        * ID
        * Water value (Bit)
        * Temp value (Int)
        * Timestamp of insertion into database (Timestamp)
    * MySQL/MariaDB is fairly easy to access from PHP and Python
