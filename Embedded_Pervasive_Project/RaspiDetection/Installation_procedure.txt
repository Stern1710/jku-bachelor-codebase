# Important: Currently install.sh is UNDER CONSTRUCTION! -> Yet maybe Step 3+4 are now obsolete by the script
# Refere to this manual here for safe installation!
# Also install.sh can only deal with software-sided setup -> All HW-Work must be done by hand

1) Get a raspberry pi + SenseHat + assemble
    * This guide references the raspian lite image

2) Wire stuff up
    * Water Detection Sensor + attached ADC
        * ADC Ground to any ground (example PIN 39)
        * VDD (+5V) to Pin 37 (GPIO26)
        * Data-Line (Example DO) to Pin 35 (GPIO19)

NOTE: Step 3+4 should be automated by install.sh now

3) Get raspian, install + do all updates
    * Expand file system
        * Note: This is hardly ever needed today as raspian / noobs is doing this automatically
        * sudo raspi-config -->  Advanced --> Expand file system
        * Can also be done by: sudo raspi-config --expand-rootfs
    * reboot raspberry with sudo poweroff --reboot
    * sudo apt update
    * sudo apt ugprade

4) Install sense-hat & other important packages
    * sudo apt install sense-hat -y
    * sudo apt install python-gpiozero -y
    * sudo apt install python-pip
    * sudo pip install paho-mqtt

5) Get all needed script files in same folder
    * We recommend in this case ~/ as we reference this folder in the following
        * getSensorData.py
        * Modify the MQTT server IP-adress! (using nano getSensorData.py --> MQTT_SERVER)

6) Run script for testing
    * Note: There must be a receiver (called subscriber) listening to "water" and "temp" channel
    * python getSensorData.py
    * Check on MQTT reciever if the data has arrived

7) Setup cron job for getSensorData.py
    * sudo crontab -e
    * Insert at bottom of file (without "")
      */10 * * * * /usr/bin/python /home/pi/getSensorData.py
